Team Fortress 2 is a team based FPS game created by Valve Corporation and downloadable on [Steam] (https://store.steampowered.com/apps/440). It is the continuation of Team Fortress, an original FPS from 1996. The game has gotten more than 300,000 ratings on Steam itself and was rated 4.5/5 from Metacritic. It still continues to be a great multiplayer game today.

I (IndieKA) am creating a replica of Team Fortress 2 on Khan Academy, the same site in which I will be creating my Garry's Mod KA Project w/Yokuda. Want to check it out?

## About
Team Fortress 2 is a team-based, first person shooter developed by VALVe (Valve Corporation) and is found on Steam to download. It is the sequel to the 1996 mod Team Fortress and its 1999 remake. It was originally released for the video game compilation _The Orange Box_ on October 10th, 2007, and it was only till April 8th, 2008 that the game would become a standalone title for Windows. Eventually, it was downloadable on Linux and OS X, making the game available for more players.

In _Team Fortress 2_, players are selected to join one of two teams (red vs. blue) choosing nine different character classes, each having a special ability and trait. The game has multiple game modes and maps, such as Capture the Flag and King of the Hill. Team Fortress 2 is also featured in the 3D classic sandbox _Garry's Mod_ and is powered by VALVe's _Source_ engine. The game received much attraction from YouTubers such as Tobuscus (Toby Turner) and PewDiePie (Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg) for its art, humor, and efficient gameplay. VALVe continues to update Team Fortress 2, releasing new content and new maps either according to the time of year or just a usual update. 

**Game modes:**
The objective of the mode depends on what it is, so let's find out.
* In CTF (Capture The Flag) maps, the main objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase, containing "secrets" about the other team's plans, and returning it to their base to receive a point for their team, eventually leading up to see which team has the most points of them all. A match lasts till one team gets a higher score or time runs out. 
* Control Point mode is where a team stays near a "control point" for a short amount of time to get a point. However, if you leave a point out in the open, the other team has a chance to claim it. The team with the most points at the end of the round wins.
* King of the Hill mode is where there is a single control point out in the open, at the center of the designated map. Teams will fight over it, and if one team reaches the point first, a countdown is made until the round. If the opposing team intercepts it, their countdown starts, breaking the other team's launch procedure. The winning team is judged by which team can stay the longest till their countdown is over.
* Arena is a team deathmatch mode, where you have to either support or fight till the end for your team; there is no respawning at all. Dying inside the game will immediately make you a spectator, watching over how your other teammates do. A team wins the round by either capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team members.
* Mann vs Machine is a six player co-op mode where the mercs have to defend a structure from waves of robots. Players have the ability to buy upgrades and improvements between rounds using in-game money earned during previous waves. 

**Characters:**
Team Fortress 2 features nine different characters categorized into offense, defense, and support roles. Each class has strengths and weaknesses; and must work with other players of different classes to have their team win. 
(information from _Wikipedia_ [Team Fortress 2])

**Offense:** 
* **The Scout:** is baseball fan and street runner from Boston, Massachusetts, who practiced running to "beat his maddog siblings to the fray.". He is a fast, agile character, armed with a scattergun, a pistol and an aluminum baseball bat. The Scout can double-jump and captures control points and pushes payloads twice as fast as other classes, but has the lowest health.
* **The Soldier:**  is more durable, but slower. The Soldier is armed with a rocket launcher, shotgun, and a folding shovel. The Soldier can use his rocket launcher to rocket jump to higher positions at the cost of some health.
* **The Pyro:** is a mentally unstable maniac of unknown gender who is armed with a with a flamethrower, fire axe, and a shotgun. 

**Defense:** 
* **The Demoman:** is a one eyed, heavy-drinking person armed with a glass bottle and some grenades with sticky bombs.
* **The Heavyman:** (voiced by the same person as _The Demoman_) is a large Russian who, although is the slowest class, can deal immense amounts of damage to players using a enormous minigun labeled "Sasha".
* **The Engineer:** is a character which can build sentry turrets and other objects to help his team, and is armed with a shotgun and a wrench tool that fixes things on hit. 

**Support:**
* **The Medic:** is a doctor armed with a "Medi Gun" which heals teammates and gradually builds a power that gives effect to the Medic. He keeps doves as pets, sometimes bloody.
* **The Sniper:** is of course, a sniper armed with a kukri (for close combat) and a long range sniper for helping take out enemies. Players usually find other snipers on towers and high positions. 
* **The Spy:** is an agent with tools like a "butterfly" knife and a device used to sabotage Engineer's buildings. His "butterfly" knife can take out any character (only if it is a backstab)
